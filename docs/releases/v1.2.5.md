# ControlForge Structured Text v1.2.5

**Release Date:** February 10, 2026

## Overview

Version 1.2.5 fixes several critical bugs from the initial LSP launch, including duplicate completions, extension packaging issues, and memory leaks.

## What's Fixed

- **Duplicate completions**: Removed redundant completion provider from extension client (#37)
- **Test environment**: npm test works in clean environments (#38)
- **Extension packaging**: iec61131-definitions/ now accessible in packaged .vsix (#39)
- **Workspace portability**: Removed hardcoded directory name lookup (#40)
- **Case sensitivity**: Symbol lookup normalized per IEC 61131-3 (#42)
- **Memory leak**: Index cleanup on file close, debounced change handling (#43)

## What's Changed

- Extension path passed via LSP initialization instead of hardcoded lookup
- Normalized symbol names for case-insensitive compliance
- Debounced document change handling for typing performance

# ControlForge Structured Text v1.2.3

## Bug Fixes

### Comprehensive LSP Initialization Fix
- Thorough fix for vscode-languageclient module resolution error
- Implemented robust fallback mechanism for module imports
- Enhanced dependency bundling for reliable deployment
- Added detailed error reporting for language server issues

## Performance Improvements

### Webpack-based Bundling
- Migrated to webpack for optimal extension packaging
- Reduced extension size for faster installation
- Improved startup time with optimized code bundling
- Enhanced reliability across different VS Code environments

## Development Notes

After struggling with the Language Server Protocol issues and trying multiple approaches, we've implemented a webpack-based bundling solution that we hope might resolve the problem. This was a challenging refactoring effort, and while we can't be certain, we're cautiously optimistic that it might eliminate the module resolution errors some users experienced.

What's particularly puzzling is that the extension works perfectly fine in development and debugging environments, with issues only appearing in certain production deployments. This inconsistency has made troubleshooting especially difficult.

We're hopeful this version will provide better compatibility with VS Code 1.100.0 across different environments and possibly resolve the critical error that prevented the language server from initializing properly. Fingers crossed!

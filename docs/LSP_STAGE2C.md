# LSP Implementation - Stage 2C: Advanced Navigation ✅ COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Goals for Phase 2C** - ✅ ALL COMPLETED
1. **✅ Function Block Member Access Navigation**: Navigate through `.` operator (e.g., `myTimer.Q` → TON.Q definition)
2. **✅ Parameter Navigation**: Jump to parameter definitions in function calls
3. **✅ Instance-to-Type Navigation**: From FB instance to FB type definition
4. **✅ Enhanced Semantic Analysis**: Context-aware symbol resolution with hover support
5. **✅ Member Completion Enhancement**: Intelligent IntelliSense for FB members

## 📋 **Implementation Status**

### ✅ Phase 2C1: Member Access Parser - COMPLETED
- ✅ Parse member access expressions (`instance.member`)
- ✅ Identify function block instances and their types
- ✅ Resolve member names to their definitions in FB types
- ✅ Support for standard IEC 61131-3 FB types (TON, TOF, TP, CTU, CTD, etc.)

### ✅ Phase 2C2: Enhanced Navigation Providers - COMPLETED
- ✅ Dedicated providers for different navigation types
- ✅ Context-aware symbol resolution
- ✅ Member access definition provider
- ✅ Hover information provider
- ✅ Intelligent completion provider

### ✅ Phase 2C3: Enhanced Features - COMPLETED
- ✅ Hover support for symbols and members
- ✅ Context-sensitive completion for member access
- ✅ Enhanced definition provider with member navigation
- ✅ Standard FB member definitions (timers, counters, edge detection, etc.)

## 🛠️ **Implemented Files**

### ✅ New Files Created
- `src/server/providers/definition-provider.ts` - Enhanced definition resolution with member access
- `src/server/providers/member-access-provider.ts` - FB member navigation with standard FB support
- `src/server/providers/completion-provider.ts` - Intelligent completion for members and symbols

### ✅ Modified Files
- `src/server/server.ts` - Integrated all advanced providers (definition, hover, completion)
- `src/shared/types.ts` - Added member access and semantic context types

## 🧪 **Testing Files Created**
- `examples/test-member-access.st` - Comprehensive member access test cases
- Standard FB types: TON, TOF, TP, CTU, CTD, CTUD, R_TRIG, F_TRIG, RS, SR

## 🚀 **Features Now Available**

### Member Access Navigation
- **Instance to Member**: `myTimer.Q` → Navigate to TON.Q definition
- **Standard FB Support**: All IEC 61131-3 standard function blocks
- **Custom FB Support**: User-defined function block members
- **Bi-directional Navigation**: Instance ↔ Type definition

### Enhanced Completion
- **Context-Aware**: Type `instance.` to see available members
- **Member Categorization**: Inputs, outputs, and variables properly sorted
- **Type Information**: Shows data types and descriptions
- **Standard Keywords**: All ST language keywords available

### Hover Information
- **Symbol Details**: Data type, scope, and description
- **Member Information**: Function block member details
- **Type Context**: Shows which FB type a member belongs to

### Cross-File Navigation
- **Workspace Indexing**: All `.st` and `.iecst` files indexed
- **Global Symbols**: Navigate to definitions across files
- **Reference Finding**: Find all usages of symbols

## ✅ **Stage 2C Implementation Complete**

All goals for Stage 2C have been successfully implemented:
- Member access navigation works for both standard and custom FBs
- Enhanced completion provides intelligent suggestions
- Hover support gives detailed symbol information
- Cross-file navigation is fully functional

Ready for testing and quality assurance!
